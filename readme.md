# microservice demo

In this project, I will use a online shop give you an introduction about the whole life cycle of design, development, operation and maintenance of microservices.

## Microservice Definition
Martin Fowler's definition:
>In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

Chris Richardson's definition:

>Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are
>  - Highly maintainable and testable
>  - Loosely coupled
>  - Independently deployable
>  - Organized around business capabilities.
>  
>The microservice architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

Red Hat's definition:

>Microservices are both an architecture and an approach to writing software. With microservices, applications are broken down into their smallest components, independent from each other. Instead of a traditional, monolithic, approach to apps, where everything is built into a single piece, microservices are all separated and work together to accomplish the same tasks. Each of these components, or processes, is a microservice. This approach to software development values granularity, being lightweight, and the ability to [share similar process across multiple apps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration). It is a major component of [optimizing application development towards a cloud-native model](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps).
